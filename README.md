# Belvita-Interacitive-Design
This is part of the digital branding expression project on Belvita breakfast biscuit. The purpose of this piece is to design an interactive LED display screen as an advertising platform. 
The promotional concept is the breakfast on the go and being inspired by speed and movement related to the concept, the motion graphic is constantly changing with the wind speed and direction of the current location, and the colour of the pattern and the movement of the biscuit icon change with live camera capture and interact with users.
